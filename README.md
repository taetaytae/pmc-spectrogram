#   Spectrogram

A spectrogram that allows the user to see a real-time analysis of a loaded in .wav file, along with giving the user the ability to apply some form of filtering to the audio file so they can see how this affects the spectrogram analysis.

The visuals are being handled by openFrameworks while the audio is being handled by ofxMaxim. A short demo of the spectrogram can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/333106180
